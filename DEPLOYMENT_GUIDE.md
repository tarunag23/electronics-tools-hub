# 🚀 Deployment Guide - Electronics Engineering Tools Hub

## Option 1: Deploy to Render (Recommended)

Render is perfect for Python Flask apps and offers free hosting.

### Steps:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Electronics Tools Hub"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/electronics-tools-hub.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Render**
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Sign up/login with your GitHub account
   - Click "New +" → "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Use these settings:
     - **Name**: electronics-tools-hub
     - **Environment**: Python 3
     - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
     - **Start Command**: `python app.py`
   - Click "Create Web Service"

3. **Your app will be live at**: `https://electronics-tools-hub-XXXX.onrender.com`

## Option 2: Deploy to Vercel (Frontend Only)

Since Vercel is primarily for frontend apps, you'd need to modify the approach.

### Steps:

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Create vercel.json**
   ```json
   {
     "functions": {
       "app.py": {
         "runtime": "python3.9"
       }
     },
     "routes": [
       {
         "src": "/(.*)",
         "dest": "app.py"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Option 3: GitHub Pages (Static Only)

GitHub Pages only hosts static sites, so you'd need to:

1. **Generate Static Data**
   - Run the data collector locally
   - Create a static HTML version with embedded JSON data

2. **Deploy**
   - Push to GitHub
   - Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
   - Select source branch (usually `main`)
