- **Data Storage**: JSON file-based storage
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy

The interface was intentionally designed to look like a beginner's work:
- Simple color scheme (basic colors, borders)
- Straightforward layout without fancy animations
- Classic HTML elements (marquee tag for nostalgic feel)
- Basic styling that a student might create

## ðŸ“ˆ Perfect for the Challenge
