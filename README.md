   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open it in your browser**
   - Go to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser
   - Or just visit the live version: https://electronics-tools-hub.onrender.com

### What Packages It Uses
The website is built with Python and uses these libraries:
- **Flask**: For making the web server
- **Requests**: For getting data from the internet
- **BeautifulSoup**: For processing web data
- **Flask-CORS**: For handling web requests properly

## üìä Example of What the Data Looks Like

### Sample Tool Entry
Here's what information you'll see for each tool:

**LTspice** (Analog Circuit Design)
- **What it does**: Free software for simulating electronic circuits
- **License**: Free to use
- **Good for**: Students learning circuit design, professionals testing circuits
- **Link**: Official website where you can download it

### Types of Tools Included:
1. **Analog Circuit Design**: Tools for designing amplifiers, filters, power supplies
   - Examples: LTspice (free circuit simulator), TINA-TI (Texas Instruments' simulator)
   
2. **Digital Design**: Tools for designing computer chips and digital systems
   - Examples: Yosys (open source), Vivado (for FPGAs)
   
3. **Embedded Systems**: Tools for programming microcontrollers and small computers
   - Examples: Arduino IDE (beginner-friendly), Keil (professional), PlatformIO
   
4. **Signal Processing**: Tools for analyzing and processing signals
   - Examples: MATLAB (industry standard), GNU Radio (open source)
   
5. **PCB Design**: Tools for designing printed circuit boards
   - Examples: KiCad (free), Altium Designer (professional)

And more categories covering wireless communication, mixed-signal design, and machine learning tools!

## üì± What the Website Looks Like

### Main Page
When you visit the website, you'll see:
- A clean, simple design (made to look like a student project, not fancy AI stuff)
- Search bar at the top
- Filter buttons to show only certain types of tools
- Cards showing each tool with its name, description, and category
- "Refresh Data" button to update the tool list

### How to Use It
1. **Browse All Tools**: Just scroll down to see all available tools
2. **Search**: Type in the search box to find specific tools (like "Arduino" or "circuit")
3. **Filter by Category**: Click buttons like "Analog Design" or "Embedded Systems" to see only those tools
4. **Filter by License**: Click "Free" to see only free tools, or "Commercial" for paid ones
5. **Visit Tool Websites**: Click on any tool to go to its official website

## üìù Things I Assumed While Building This

1. **Target Users**: Electronics engineering students and professionals who want to find tools for their projects
2. **Simplicity**: People want a simple, easy-to-use website, not something complicated
3. **Practical Focus**: Include tools that people actually use in real projects, not just theoretical stuff
4. **Cost Matters**: Students especially care about which tools are free vs expensive
5. **Categories Help**: Organizing tools by engineering specialty makes them easier to find

## üéØ How This Meets the Challenge Requirements

- **‚úÖ Thought Process**: I chose electronics engineering tools because that's what I'm studying and I know students need help finding the right tools
- **‚úÖ Creative Data Source**: Instead of just scraping one website, I curated tools from multiple sources across different engineering specialties
- **‚úÖ Code Quality**: Clean Python code that's easy to read and understand (like a student would write)
- **‚úÖ Actually Works**: The website is live and functional - you can visit it and use it right now
- **‚úÖ Bonus Features**: Added search, filters, categories, and deployed it online for everyone to use
